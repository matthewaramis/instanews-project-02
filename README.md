# Instanews Project 02

The intent of this project was to create a responsive web app that pulled information from the New York Times API.

The web app was built with _Visual Studio Code_ and _GULP_.

Through this project, I developed my skills in **jQuery** and **API**'s, while also changing the way I style with CSS using **SASS**.
